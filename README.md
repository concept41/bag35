## Design
### Quarterly 13F Data
#### Gathering and processing data
At a high level, the general process for gathering and processing 13F data is as follows:
```mermaid
graph TD
  1(data is manually downloaded from the SEC into /downloads)
  2(quarterly data is scraped into processed files in /scraped)
  3(CIKs and CUSIPs are identified and written into respective files in /scraped)
  4(data is ingested into neo4j using the files in /scraped)
```

scraping is synchonous, extracting from downloaded data
identification is asynchronous, using external sources to query for dataâ€” however it is idempotent
ingestion is synchonous as well
for ingestion:
 - entity ingestion is idempotent
 - equity ingestion is idempotent
 - submission ingestion is idempotent

#### 13F Glossary and Relationships
CIK
CUSIP
Submission type
  13F-HR Initial Quarterly Form 13F Holdings Report filed by institutional managers
  13F-HR/A Amendment to a Quarterly Form 13F Holdings Report filed by institutional managers
  13F-NT Initial Quarterly Form 13F Notice Report filed by institutional managers
  13F-NT/A Amendment to a Quarterly Form 13F Notice Report filed by institutional managers
ACCESSION_NUMBER

#### Amendments
When a report is amended, the amendment will use the same period of report (PERIODOFREPORT) as the filing that is being ammended

it appears that ammendments are a complete refiling, rather than a diff of changes to be made
